# Ozone Lightroom Presets
This will hopefully become a collection of Adobe Lightroom presets I use when I develop photos in Adobe Lightroom and Lightroom Classic.

So far there's only one preset, the Light Map preset that I recently developed, but I have a few more so there will be further updates.

## Installation

* Download the latest release as a zip file from the Releases page here and unzip it. You'll find the presets in the Ozone directory. You can also download any .xmp file separately by viewing the file and clicking on the "RAW" view button. You can save it using CMD-s (Mac) or CTRL-s (Windows/Linux) to your Downloads folder.
* Open up Lightroom or Lightroom Classic.
* Click on `File > Import Develop Profiles and Presets` in Lightroom Classic and `File > Import Profiles and Presets` in Lightroom.
* Navigate to where you have downloaded and unzipped this collection and click to import them.
* You will find any presets here in the "Ozone" group in Lightroom when you're looking through your presets.
* Right click on the preset and `Add to favourites` if you want quick access to it.

## Light Map (5)

Right click on [Light Map (5).xmp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnchawp/lightroom-presets/main/Ozone/Light%20Map%20(5).xmp) and save to your computer.

This is a preset that will add 5 luminance range masks to your image. You can use it to quickly edit different parts of your image so you can treat bright areas differently to dark areas.

For example, in a sunset photo you can use the "Light" masks to modify the sky and bright parts of the landscape, while the "Dark" masks will help you deepen shadows.
